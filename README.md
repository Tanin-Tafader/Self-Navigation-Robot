# Self-Navigation-Robot

This repository contains a naviagion program which was made in the CodeWarrior IDE using HCS12 Assembly.

The program script allows the robot to traverse a maze, making decisions accordingly when encountering a junction/obstacle. Different subystems were used in the project which inlcude  a navigation manager, guidance routine, sensor scanner, motor speed control, rotation counters and bumper detectors.
